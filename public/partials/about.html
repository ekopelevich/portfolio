  <p>Prior to entering the world of web development, I had a successful career in marketing. In that past life, I brought together unique skill sets in <span class="strong">graphic design, copywriting, illustration, communications and strategic management to drive rapid growth</span> at several organizations. I've worked in corporate and start-up style environments and I've proven to be adaptable, resourceful and helpful on every team.</p>
