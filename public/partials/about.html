  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a full stack web developer with marketing and design skills. I am about to finish the Galvanize Full Stack Intensive Program in Denver, CO.</p>
  <p>As I approach graduation, I'm looking to start a conversation with a forward-thinking company that seeks an honest, determined, junior developer.</p>
  <p>I have a solid foundation in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Node, Express, Angular, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, RESTful Design and web sockets. I use Git on a daily basis and have seen the value of an Agile workflow. Iâ€™ve also explored Ruby on Rails, Python and Swift. I am comfortable asking targeted questions, finding answers in documentation and experimenting with solutions a logical way.</p>
  <p>Prior to entering the world of web development, I had a successful career in marketing. In that past life, I brought together unique skill sets in graphic design, copywriting, illustration, communications and strategic management to drive rapid growth at several organizations. I've worked in corporate and start-up style environments and I've proven to be adaptable, resourceful and helpful on every team.</p>
  <p>I enjoy casual sports (like dodgeball, surfing and skiing), illustration, design, writing, reading and drinking good coffee. I also care a lot about animals, education and clean energy. Most importantly, I am passionate about learning.</p>
